        In this page the author talks about the pros and cons of the Chandler project. 
    The Chandler project was a project that was user friendly. It had a person to person setup.
    The author talked about the flaws as well. One of the examples used was how they used the Python
    programming language. They brought along new programmers and had them start learning Python and 
    allowed them to start on Chandler. This was a mistake cause when you bring someone new to a 
    program it puts a halt on the productivity of that program, cause you have to take the time to 
    teach the person the way things are done. You also have to supervise while that person works to 
    make sure that they don't mess up the whole thing and so you can correct the errors so that they 
    don't become habits.

    getting ready to launch their product for the first time. The 
    statements sound really good. Sounds like they are aiming for 
    a fresh spin on something familiar.

    the customer. They want to start small to make sure that they 
    don't grow to fast and hurt themselves. Looks like they also plan 
    on making sure the vital elements of a successful company in the 
    computer world.
