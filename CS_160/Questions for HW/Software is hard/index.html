            Software is Hard 
    
            <pre style="color:rgb(122, 24, 24); text-align: left;">
    In the article "Software is Hard" the author talks about the pros and cons
of the Chandler project. The Chandler project was a project that was user
friendly. It had a person to person setup. The author talked about the
flaws as well. One of the examples used was how they used the Python 
programming language. They brought along new programmers and had them start
learning Python and allowed them to start on Chandler. This was a mistake
cause when you bring someone new to a program it puts a halt on the
productivity of that program, cause you have to take the time to teach the
person the way things are done. You also have to supervise while that person 
works to make sure that they don't mess up the whole thing and so you can
correct the errors so that they don't become habits.

        <pre style="color:rgb(122, 24, 24); text-align: left;">
    The author goes on to talk about how many lines of code are in some
projects. Like he says that in a F22 there is 750,000 lines of code.
Which is a lot of code. But he said that the MYST game had way more code
than that of a fighter plane. The author covers some of the topics that 
were discussed in Dreaming in Code. An example of this was where he talked
about there being No Silver Bullets. It was a very interesting read. He 
covered many topics in the little amount of text he wrote. This essay was
very easy to read.
